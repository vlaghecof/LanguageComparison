"# LanguageComparison" 

The purpose of this project is to establish a set of Microbenches in order to study
the performance of various programming languages . In this paper we will crate a set of tests
to see how different programming languages perform in a various set of scenarios , in the end
providing a comparison between them . To this purpose, the languages that we will be studied
are Java , C# and Python.  

Java and C# are were chosen because they very popular choices when it comes to
working with the Object Oriented programming paradigm (OOP), and we want to observe their
strong points.  

Python was selected because it has recently became the most popular programming
language, according to the PYPL index. The strength of the language is in the fact that is a very
versatile programming language, that can be applied to anything.
In the end we also want to establish a comparison between two types of typing , static
typing ( represented by the Java , C#) and dynamic typing (Python)
